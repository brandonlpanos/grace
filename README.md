Discover possible lost geodesy gravitational signals using a Mutual Information Neural Estimator on residuals. The theory for MINE-networks can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04062.pdf. For a description of Mutual Information see the book: Elements of Information Theory by Thomas Cover. PMI is bounded by -infinity and min( -log p(x), -log p(y) ). A PMI of =<0, means no dependancy, while a PMI >0 means a dependency (possible higher order correlation). We calculate PMI between location vectors and their associated scalar residuals. A single script (grace_pmi.py) trains a model to calculate the PMI for each instance of each month. Each month's model, training curve, and PMI are saved. The PMI can be read off of the last column from the CSV file.
