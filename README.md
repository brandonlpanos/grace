Discover possible lost geodesy gravitational signals using a Mutual Information Neural Estimator on residuals. The theory for MINE-networks can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04062.pdf. For a description of Mutual Information Elements of Information Theory by Thomas Cover. A PMI of =<0, means no dependancy, while >0 means a dependency (possible higher order correlation).
